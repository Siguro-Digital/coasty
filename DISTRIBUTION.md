# Distributing Coasty Automation

## Option 1: Simple Zip Package (Recommended for Non-Developers)

This is the easiest way to share the tool:

1. **Package everything:**
   ```bash
   # Exclude unnecessary files
   zip -r coasty-automation.zip . \
     -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*" "*.log" \
     "playwright-session/*" "venv/*" ".env"
   ```

2. **Include these files:**
   - All `.js` files
   - All `.py` files  
   - `package.json`
   - `checklists.csv`
   - `subforms/` folder
   - `subforms_pdf_ai/` folder
   - `setup.sh`, `setup.ps1`
   - `run.sh`, `run.ps1`
   - `QUICK_START.md`
   - `SETUP_GUIDE.md`

3. **Instructions for recipient:**
   - Extract the zip file
   - Follow `QUICK_START.md`
   - Run `setup.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `setup.ps1` (Windows)
   - Run `run.sh` or `run.ps1` to start

## Option 2: Using pkg (Single Executable)

**Note:** This requires more setup and Playwright browser binaries need special handling.

### Installation:
```bash
npm install -g pkg
```

### Create executable:
```bash
# Package the main script
pkg playwright/create-subform-live.js --targets node18-macos-x64,node18-win-x64,node18-linux-x64 --output coasty-automation
```

**Limitations:**
- Playwright browsers won't be bundled (they'll need to run `npx playwright install` separately)
- Python scripts won't be included
- May require manual browser installation on target system

## Option 3: Electron App (Advanced)

For a full desktop application, you could wrap it in Electron, but this requires significant development.

## Recommended Approach

**For non-developers, use Option 1 (Zip Package):**

1. Create a zip with the project
2. Include clear instructions (`QUICK_START.md`)
3. They install Node.js once
4. Run `setup.sh` or `setup.ps1`
5. Use `run.sh` or `run.ps1` to launch

This is simpler than a single executable and avoids Playwright browser bundling issues.

## What to Include in Distribution

### Required Files:
- All JavaScript files (`*.js`)
- All Python files (`*.py`)
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `checklists.csv`
- `subforms/` directory (with all JSON files)
- `subforms_pdf_ai/` directory (can be generated, but nice to include)
- Setup scripts (`setup.sh`, `setup.ps1`, `run.sh`, `run.ps1`)
- Documentation (`QUICK_START.md`, `SETUP_GUIDE.md`)

### Exclude:
- `node_modules/` (will be regenerated by `npm install`)
- `playwright-session/` (user-specific browser data)
- `venv/` (Python virtual environment, can be regenerated)
- `.env` (should be created by user)
- `.git/` (version control, not needed)
- `*.log` files

## Creating the Distribution Package

Run this script to create a clean distribution:

```bash
# Create distribution folder
mkdir -p coasty-distribution
cp -r playwright/ coasty-distribution/
cp *.js *.json *.md *.csv *.sh *.ps1 coasty-distribution/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp -r subforms coasty-distribution/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp generate_*.py coasty-distribution/ 2>/dev/null || true

# Create zip
cd coasty-distribution
zip -r ../coasty-automation.zip .
cd ..
```

## Instructions for Recipient

1. Extract `coasty-automation.zip`
2. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
3. Open Terminal/PowerShell in the extracted folder
4. Run `./setup.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `.\setup.ps1` (Windows)
5. Run `./run.sh` (Mac/Linux) or `.\run.ps1` (Windows)

That's it!
